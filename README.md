# Weareframework
This is the repo for the lets the code project that we are going to build over the next few months.

Our aim is to keep this open, fun, engaging, experimental and to encourage everyone to feel comfortable in taking part and keeping the code as the star.

Good code allows us to push ourselves to bring more complex and creative designs to life.
We pride ourselves in creativity, innovation, and collaboration to solve problems with unique and creative solutions.

Your ideas, big or small, matter.
